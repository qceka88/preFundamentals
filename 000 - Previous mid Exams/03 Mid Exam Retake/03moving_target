Problem 3 - Moving Target
Problem for exam preparation for the Programming Fundamentals Course @SoftUni.
Submit your solutions in the SoftUni judge system at https://judge.softuni.org/Contests/Practice/Index/2305#2.

You are at the shooting gallery again, and you need a program that helps you keep track of moving targets.
On the first line, you will receive a sequence of targets with their integer values, split by a single space. 
Then, you will start receiving commands for manipulating the targets until the "End" command. 
The commands are the following:
•	"Shoot {index} {power}"
o	Shoot the target at the index if it exists by reducing its value by the given power (integer value). 
o	Remove the target if it is shot. A target is considered shot when its value reaches 0.
•	"Add {index} {value}"
o	Insert a target with the received value at the received index if it exists. 
o	If not, print: "Invalid placement!"
•	"Strike {index} {radius}"
o	Remove the target at the given index and the ones before and after it depending on the radius.
o	If any of the indices in the range is invalid, print: "Strike missed!" and skip this command.
 Example:  "Strike 2 2"
	{radius}	{radius}	{strikeIndex}	{radius}	{radius}		

•	"End"
o	Print the sequence with targets in the following format and end the program:
"{target1}|{target2}…|{targetn}"
Input / Constraints
•	On the first line, you will receive the sequence of targets – integer values [1-10000].
•	On the following lines, until the "End" will be receiving the command described above – strings.
•	There will never be a case when the "Strike" command would empty the whole sequence.
Output
•	Print the appropriate message in case of any command if necessary.
•	In the end, print the sequence of targets in the format described above.

Example_01

Input
52 74 23 44 96 110
Shoot 5 10
Shoot 1 80
Strike 2 1
Add 22 3
End	

Output
Invalid placement!
52|100	

Explanation
The first command is "Shoot", so we reduce the target on index 5, which is valid, with the given power – 10. 
Then we receive the same command, but we need to reduce the target on the 1st index, with power 80. 
The value of this target is 74, so it is considered shot, and we remove it. 
Then we receive the "Strike" command on the 2nd index, and we need to check if the range with radius 1 is valid:
52 23 44 96 100
And it is, so we remove the targets. 
At last, we receive the "Add" command, but the index is invalid,
so we print the appropriate message, and in the end, we have the following result:
52|100
