#################################### TASK CONDITION ############################
3.	Treasure Finder
Write a program that decrypts a message by a given key and gathers information about 
hidden treasure type and its coordinates. On the first line, you will receive a key 
(sequence of numbers separated by a space). On the next few lines, you will receive 
lines with strings until you get the command "find". 
You should loop through every string and decrease the ASCII code of each character with
a corresponding number of the key sequence. You choose a key number from the sequence by 
just looping through it. If the length of the key sequence is less than the string sequence, 
you should continue looping from the beginning. 
For more clarification, see the example below. 
After decrypting the message, you will get a type of treasure and its coordinates.
The type will be between the symbol "&", and the coordinates - between the symbols "<' and '>'. 
For each line print the type and the coordinates in the format "Found {type} at {coordinates}".

find	

Output
Found gold at 10N70W
Found Silver at 32S43W

Explanation
We start looping through the first string and the key. 
When we reach the end of the key, we start looping from the beginning of the key,
but we continue looping through the string. (until the string is over)
The first message is: "hidden&gold&at<10N70W>" so we print we found gold at the given coordinates
We do the same for the second string 
"thereIs&Silver&atCoordinates<32S43W>"(starting from the beginning of the key and the beginning of the string)
