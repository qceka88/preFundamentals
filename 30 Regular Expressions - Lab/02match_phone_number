#################################### TASK CONDITION ############################
2.	Match Phone Number
Write a regular expression to match a valid phone number from Sofia. 
After you find all valid phones, print them on the console, separated by a comma and a space ", ".
Compose the Regular Expression
A valid number has the following characteristics:
•	It starts with "+359"
•	Then, it is followed by the area code (always 2)
•	After that, it is followed by a number:
o	The number consists of 7 digits (separated into two groups of 3 and 4 digits, respectively). 
•	The different parts are separated by either a space or a hyphen ('-').
You can use the following RegEx properties to help with the matching: 
•	Use quantifiers to match a specific number of digits
•	Use a capturing group to make sure the delimiter is only one of the allowed characters 
(space or hyphen) and not a combination of both (e.g., +359 2-111 111 has mixed delimiters, it is invalid).
Use a group backreference to achieve this.
•	Add a word boundary at the end of the match to avoid partial matches.
•	Ensure that there is a space before the '+' sign, or it is positioned at the beginning of the string.

Match ALL of these
+359 2 222 2222
+359-2-222-2222

Match NONE of these
359-2-222-2222, +359/2/222/2222, +359-2 222 2222
+359 2-222-2222, +359-2-222-222, +359-2-222-22222
