#################################### TASK CONDITION ############################

9.	* Movie
Create a class Movie. The __init__ method should receive a name and a director.
It should also have a default value of an attribute called watched set to False.
There should also be a class attribute __watched_movies which will keep track of the number of all the watched movies.
The class should have the following methods:

•	change_name(new_name: str) - changes the name of the movie
•	change_director(new_director: str) - changes the director of the movie
•	watch() - change the watched attribute to True and increase the total watched movies class attribute (if the movie is not already watched)
•	__repr__() - returns "Movie name: {name}; Movie director: {director}. Total watched movies: {__watched_movies}"
