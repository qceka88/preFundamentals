    3.	Email
Create class Email. The __init__ method should receive sender, receiver and a content. It should also have a default set to False attribute called is_sent. The class should have two additional methods:
•	send() - sets the is_sent attribute to True
•	get_info() - returns the following string: "{sender} says to {receiver}: {content}. Sent: {is_sent}"
You will receive some information (separated by a single space) until you receive the command "Stop". The first element will be the sender, the second one – the receiver, and the third one – the content. On the final line, you will be given the indices of the sent emails separated by comma and space ", ". 
Call the send() method for the given indices of emails. For each email, call the get_info() method.
Note: submit all of your code, including the class
