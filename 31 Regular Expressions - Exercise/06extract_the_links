#################################### TASK CONDITION ############################
6.	*Extract the Links
Write a program that extracts links from a given text. The text will come in the form of strings,
each representing a sentence. You need to extract only the valid links from it. Example:

                         "www    .       internet       .            com"

                      Sub-Domain			 Domain name		        Domain extension
The Sub-Domain must always be "www". The Domain name can consist of English alphabet letters 
(uppercase and lowercase), digits, and dashes ("–"). The Domain extension consists of one or more domain blocks,
a domain block consists of a dot followed by one or more lowercase English alphabet letters, 
a Domain extension must have at least one domain block in order to be valid. 
The Sub-Domain and Domain name must be separated by a single dot. Any link that does NOT follow the specified above rules should be treated as invalid.
Example incorrect links:  
•	"ww.justASite.bg"
•	"lel.awesome.com"
•	"www.weird_site.hit.bg"
•	"www.no-symb#^ols-allow%ed.com"
•	"www.mark.12"
•	"www.web-site."
•	"www.example-site._*^#"
Example of correct links:  
•	"Some textwww.softuni.bg"
•	"Just a link in a www.sea-of-text.bg-swimming around"
•	"Instruments www.Instruments.rom.com.trombone2000 Instrument here"
•	"All your ice cream flavors-www.scream.for.ice.cream(We  also have squirrels)"
 The output is all valid links you have found, printed – each on a new line.
