#################################### TASK CONDITION ############################

5.	HTML Parser
Write a program that extracts a title and all the content of a HTML file:
•	The title should be between the HTML tags <title> and <\title>. 
•	The content should be between the HTML tags <body> and <\body>.
There might be different HTML tags, which you should ignore: 
•	Each HTML tag is surrounded by the symbols "<" and ">". For example: <body>, <p>, <\html>
•	You also should ignore the HTML tag "\n"

Example: 
"<html>\n<head><title>News</title></head>\n<body><p><a href="https://softuni.bg">SoftUni</a>aims
to provide free real-world practical\n training for young people who want to turn into\n skillful Python software engineers.</p></body>\n</html>"
In this example the title is "News" and the content is "SoftUni aims to provide free real-world practical 
training for young people who want to turn into skillful Python software engineers."
Input
•	The input will be read from the console. 
•	The input consists of a single line.
Output
•	The content should be a single string. 
•	You should extract only the text without the tags. 
•	When you extract the title and the content, you should print the result in the following format:
o	"Title: {extracted title}"
o	"Content: {extracted content}"
